This paper and github gives the open source model for calculating technical and economical aspects of different sets of satellite constellation design(including starlink, oneweb and kuiper). There is a cost.py function we can use to calculate Net Present Value and total cost ownership.(Explained In paper section B). It also has the model of demand using actual geographical distribution with density less than 0.1/km^2.

This paper contains a demand model(p237) and cost estimation method(p159).

These people actually built a game for the mega satellite constellation, economically. We can use the framework of the time step and decision making process from it.
